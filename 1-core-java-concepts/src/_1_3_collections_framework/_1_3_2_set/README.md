# 1.3.2 Set

Java Set is a collection of elements (Or objects) that contains no duplicate elements. Java Set is an interface that
extends Collection interface. Unlike List, Java Set is NOT an ordered collection, itâ€™s elements does NOT have a
particular order. Java Set does NOT provide a control over the position where you can insert an element. You cannot
access elements by their index and also search elements in the list.
